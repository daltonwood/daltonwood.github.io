# Welcome to my portfolio
Hey there, my name is Dalton. This is my portfolio project using GitHub Pages.

I'll be using this as a central webpage for all of my tech-related projects, professional or personal, that I'm either pushing to GitHub or posting about on my blog.

## About
This webpage is relatively simple but I'm offering some further info here as further insight into the process.

**Template:** I used HTML5UP's Phantom as a template for this webpage, tweaking it as needed.

**Color scheme:** I'm trying to maintain consistent colors throughout, using Monokai as I am a big fan of Monokai Pro for text editors.

**Process:** I'm using Neovim to create this README but use Visual Studio Code as my primary text editor when it comes to any sort of development. I prefer Neovim for basic text editing and writing scripts.
